Some potential projects:
------
- “Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for low resource languages (i.e. building ASR systems with small datasets)”
- “Testing Deep Learning Systems, in particular automatic speech recognition systems” 
- “Language technologies for Gaeilge (the Irish language)”
- “Recognising new Signs for Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems.”
- “Improving depth estimates in pose estimation systems.”

I am also interested in anything related to the following:
- Machine Learning for audio
- Learning tasks with limited labels (anomaly detection, few shot learning, etc. ).
- Time series modelling (including sensors) and computer vision tasks are also welcome. 

I encourage students to be innovative in their approaches so if you have a cool idea, feel free to run it by me!
