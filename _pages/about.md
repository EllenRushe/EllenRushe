I'm an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at Dublin City University (DCU). My primary research interests center around deep learning with limited labels, in particular I like to work with time series and data streams (including audio and video data). More specifically, I have worked on a broad set of limited label problems including novelty detection in audio, sign language recognition and domain adaptation for rugby tackle analysis. These problems involve a relaxation of the typical requirement of deep learning systems to train on vast amounts of data.

Prior to joining DCU, I was a Research Fellow at Trinity College Dublin developing methods to analyse rugby gameplay, and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in University College Dublin (UCD) working on sign language recognition as part of the SignOn Project, a H2020 project with 17 international, interdisciplinary consortium partners. I completed my PhD in UCD on the topic of "deep novelty detection in data streams". Prior to this, I did a MSc in Computer Science (conversion) at UCD and a BA in Music Technology at Maynooth University.
